              <p>Crafters are the creative doers, dream chasers and high achievers needed to grow any nation’s economy across and beyond the country. They are seldom called the artisans but I choose to see beyond the undue limitations that comes with the title, hence the term; Crafters. Personally, I ventured into crafts with so much passion and it has been a tremendous eye-opener for me.
                 I've learnt about the common needs shared by people alongside the rich way to meet them in terms of inherent skills that are well nurtured. Nigeria is blessed with amazing Crafters who are gifted varyingly in paper craft, wood craft, stone masonry, fashion illustration, metal craft, food art, fruitful carving, crocheting, quilting, quilling, glass crafts, flower Crafts, batik, aso-oke weaving, nail art, just to mention a few. Interestingly, my current travels across the country for research unveiled a whole lot and I'm convinced, that exploring the world of crafts would do a whole lot to increase sustainable entrepreneurship drive.
                 By creating a huge buzz for the numerous kinds of crafts the country is blessed with, crafters are inspired to do more leading to increase in patronage of homemade products and culture tourism. In the long term, the economy of the country flourishes richly.
                 Some of the events/activities we’re planning and/or have executed include: Crafts party, The Crafters’ Conference, Crafts TV Show, Crafts Tourism, Crafts online, Crafts Journalism,  Crafts Magazine, Crafts News Weekly, Craftpreneurs Reality Television Show, etc.

               <p>
                 My experience in the media; prints, radio and television sustains my confidence that Crafters have been long deprived of their most deserving media mentions. Hence, I see and respect the need to engage a team to create and sustain every possible medium of Crafts Journalism. I’ve come across amazing crafters, such intelligent creative doers that deserve to be on cover pages of magazines making headline news, getting media support for crafts projects that will in large returns be their own contributive efforts towards building the nation, economically.
                The mission here is simple, celebrating crafters as the celebrities that they truly are. They are the confident set of beings who are boldly exploring their inherent skills to create solutions to apparent problems shared within/beyond their communities.
                I am a media personality with the vision to support creative doers (Craftpreneurs). My belief fuelled by my passion drives the mission to build a team of change agents who would see, promote and appreciate crafts differently. My optimism knows no bounds about the wealth of creativity every human being is blessed with, the awesome power buried in the spirit of collaborations and the ripple effects of a success story in the hearts of people and the population.
                I desire and vow that our crafts magazine (The Crafters and their Crafts) would contribute largely to the efforts at changing the narrative. I want the stories of crafters shared and well spread; I want crafters recognised and well celebrated.  I see their stories inspiring many more crafters to do more.  I see their stories convincing investors and igniting confidence for entrepreneurship drives. I see their stories leading minds unto job creations above the need to search for jobs.

               <p>
                  The dream is to pioneer immense contributions, especially in the media for the crafts industry in Africa.
                  To create media platforms, both offline and online where various kinds of crafts are explored and the amazing crafters (and craft promoters) are given adequate recognitions.
                  Crafts Party, Craft Courses, Radio Show (CraftStar of the week/month) The Crafters’ Conference, the research, the magazine; online community, television show, tourism, Crafts Journalism. …bringing to limelight the rich roles played by the uncelebrated/under celebrated craters in Africa as they are huge promoters and contributors to the development of their culture, country and continent as a whole.
                  I am glad to share this with you. I’m grateful for the terrific team members. It’ll be pleasing to see you on board as well. So far, we are here … …www.thecraftersconnect.com (and also here www.thecraftersconference.com)
